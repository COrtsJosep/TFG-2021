# TFG-2021
This repository contains (almost) all the code I used for my Final Year Project at the UPF in the Spring-Summer semester. The main objective was to estimate the density function the rental housing prices in the city of Barcelona, using nonparametric estimation on data obtained from web scraping online advertising portals.

The scraping scripts are tailored to suit the format display of information of each portal in the moment of writing them, which means that they might no longer properly work if the portals change their formats. As of May the 4th, 2021, all the scraping scripts are functional.
